# Conway's Game of Life

My third assignment in Java completed on **04/04/2021** was to build Conway's Game of Life:

You are required to finish Conway’s Game of Life, based on this template:  ConwaysGameOfLifeTemplate.pdf - Alternative Formats the code snippets and hints in the lecture notes

You can use the template as a base which will provide some of the setup and functionality. 

Your tasks will be as follows:

  •	Add game states (Playing and Not Playing).
  
  •	When the game is in the 'not playing' state, render two rectangles as ‘buttons’: one for Start and one for Random.
  
  •	Modify the mousePressed method so that it checks for clicks on the buttons' regions.
   o	The buttons you create should have the following functionality:
	    Start: switches the game state to ‘playing’
	    Random: randomises the game state

  •	When in the 'playing' state, apply the rules of Conway’s Game of Life at each repaint.
  
  •	Implement game state Loading and Saving (via ‘buttons’ as above). 
  
  •	Finally, how will you encode the game state as a string?  Explain your answer.
